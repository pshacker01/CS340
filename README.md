Project Two - Final Reflection

Grazioso Salvare Animal Rescue Dashboard
Developer: Tony McCormack
Program Design: Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Code

Throughout this project, writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code was a top priority, especially when developing the CRUD Python module in Project One. By organizing database operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) into a single reusable class, it became much easier to connect and control the dashboard widgets during Project Two. The main advantage of this approach was modularity—instead of rewriting database connection code across multiple parts of the project, I only needed to call well-structured functions from the CRUD module.
In the future, this CRUD module could easily be adapted for other dashboards or any MongoDB-backed web applications by adjusting small details like collection names, fields, or authentication. It serves as a solid foundation for scalable, professional software.
Problem Solving: My Approach as a Computer Scientist

When approaching the Grazioso Salvare dashboard project, I first broke the problem into manageable parts: database setup, CRUD module creation, dashboard widget design, and interactive filtering. Compared to previous assignments, this project was more aligned with real-world development practices, requiring coordination between backend (database) and frontend (dashboard visualization) systems.
In the future, I would continue using an incremental development strategy: building one component at a time, validating it with test data, and ensuring each piece integrates cleanly before moving on. Creating databases to meet future client requests would start with clearly understanding user requirements, designing logical queries, and ensuring that the database structure supports flexible search and visualization needs.
The Role of Computer Scientists and Project Impact

Computer scientists are problem solvers who create systems that turn data into meaningful, accessible solutions. Projects like this one show how technology can directly support a company's mission—in this case, helping Grazioso Salvare more efficiently identify dogs for life-saving rescue training.
By providing a live, interactive dashboard, the team at Grazioso Salvare can now quickly filter and visualize shelter data, saving time and making better-informed decisions. My work in this project demonstrates how applied computer science improves organizational processes, saves resources, and supports missions that create positive real-world outcomes.
